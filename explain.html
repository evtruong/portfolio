            <h1><u>Why Game Development?</u></h1>
            <h2>Why did I choose game development</h2>
            <p>I chose game development because, as a person who loves video games and knows the potential to create amazing stories as a writer at heart, I want to exploit this new medium to tell a unique interactive story, not possible in traditional books and TV shows.</p>
            <h2>Do I see myself pursuing a game development career in the future?</h2>
            <p>Yes because I love playing video games and I enjoy watching people develop games on youtube. There are so many resources out there that can help me develop a game, I just have to put my own spin on the basic template and create new, unique stories, concepts, and mechanics. People say it's a dying, unoriginal, stale medium at this point, but if books, film, and TV shows can prosper as a medium for storytelling for generations, so can video games. And besides, nothing is original. Many games are a rip from a template, just with a different individual's personality, which makes them stand out. I can change things as a video game developer in this new modern era, I can help advance the medium in new ways as I can create new interactive experiences. Progression to this medium, I can fight against corporate muddying and mindless pandering that now plagues entertainment <u>(Looking at you Activision Blizzard for re-writing history in the Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2019 game by blaming the "Highway of Death" incident on Russian forces when the United States were to blame)</u> and revive the good old days back in my childhood when games could tackle serious topics and not shy away from the nitty gritty. That is my vision of my future career, fulfilling this self-proclaimed duty to thank the games that made me who I am and built my childhood. Most importantly, even if my games ultimately fall flat and forgotten like most books, films, and TV shows, metaphorically lost in the Library of Alexandria, I will still be happy, as putting my ideas out into the world, permanently etching myself into digital history, is my final purpose in life, nothing more. I don't have to be successful, found, or remembered, I just need to be there, somewhere. That is all I need to happen to know that my life mattered in this cold indifferent universe whomst cast us humans the curse of consciousness with the blessing of wonderful but meaningless life. That is all I need to do to be fulfilled with myself and be free and happy of all guilt and pressure.</p>
