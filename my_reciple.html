        <h2>History:</h2>
        <p>The earliest origins of fried rice can be traced back to the Yangzhou region in the eastern Jiangsu province of China during the Sui Dynasty in between 593 to 618 CE. As you know, rice is an important crop in Chinese history and cultural identity, originating in the area. The Chinese peoples have cultivated it for food for millennia, continuing their reliance on rice to this day. During the period of the Sui Dynasty, fried rice was a dish used by peasants as a way to bypass food waste and to use leftovers through tough economic times. Leftover rice, egg, meat, and vegetables not eaten in the last meal (food that have passed their best but were still good to digest, and too good for the animals to be fed it) were traditionally seasoned with soy sauce, lard, and garlic, and stir-fried, making a great hot meal the Chinese peasants enjoyed. Over the years, through trading goods with other nations and the surge of immigration of Chinese peoples to other nations, especially to the US, the dish has spread across the world as a favorite, morphing into different dishes reflecting different cultures.</p>
